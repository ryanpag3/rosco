## Introduction

Rosco's AutoMod feature is broken up into several modules. That way you can pick and choose which functionality is best for your server. 

### Modules

- [**Banned Words**](/commands/auto-mod/banned-words) - Prevent, or slow down, the posting of certain banned words in your server. 
- **Link Detect** - Block certain links from being posted.
- **Capslock Detect** - Detect the use of CAPITALIZED LETTERS
