## Introduction

When I am invited to your server, I start rewarding currency for participating in the following server activities:

| Activity | Reward |
|----------|--------|
| Messages | `1` |
| Reactions | `1` |
| Bot Commands Issued | `1` |

You can use this currency for various server activities, as well as create your own specific custom events for earning currency!

## `grant` - Grant a user currency

Issue `/currency grant` if you would like to issue currency to a user. 

***We highly recommend restricting this command to administrators to avoid abuse.***
