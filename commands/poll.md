## Introduction

Polls allow your users to vote on a defined topic. Upon completion, polls can be closed and results announced.

## `create` - Create a poll

Issue `/poll create` to create a poll. Polls have one `question` which is the content the users are voting on, and several `options`. Polls can have up to 10 options total.
