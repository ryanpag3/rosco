Welcome to the documentation for [Rosco](https://roscobot.com), a multi-purpose Discord bot.

**Important:** If you are on mobile, do not forget to use this icon ![mobile-wiki-icon.jpg](/mobile-wiki-icon.jpg =5%x) to open the navigation menu.

## Getting Started

Rosco has many different modules supporting a wide variety of common Discord functionalities. You may use as many or as little as you'd like and feel free to reference some of our tutorials below. 

Regardless, we do recommend you do the following on each server you invite the bot to:

1. Much of the bot depends on scheduling events around your server's particular timezone. To ensure that behavior is consistent, run the [`/timezone`](/commands/timezone) command to set the timezone to your particular region.
2. Make sure to head to [`/permission`](/commands/permission) and set your command boundaries for your members. Failing to do so could allow griefers to delete resources you want to protect.
3. If using [AutoMod](/commands/auto-mod), configure your rules and actions.

Beyond that, check out the navigation menu to the left and setup any additional features you would like to use in your server!
